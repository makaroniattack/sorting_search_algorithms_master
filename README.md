We implemented typical algorithms for sorting and searching in C# to prepare for the Basic Information Technology Engineer exam.

## Search Algorithm
# Search for the desired value from left to right #  
1.Compare [i] with the value you are looking for  
2.If there is a match, the search is completed. If there is no match, increase the value of i by one.  
3.The search continues until the desired value is matched. If the desired value is not found after searching to the end, the search is terminated.
